Registration Form with Validation

This project is a simple Registration Form created using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. The form provides real-time validation for user input fields, ensuring the data is correctly entered before allowing form submission.

Features

- Name Field: The name field cannot be left empty. A validation error message is shown if the field is blank.
- Email Field**: The email field requires a valid email address format. If the format is incorrect, an error message is displayed.
- Password Field: The password must be at least 6 characters long. If the password is too short, the user is notified.
- Disabled Submit Button: The submit button remains disabled until all fields are valid, preventing form submission with incomplete or incorrect data.

How to Use

1. Clone this repository and open the `index.html` file in any modern web browser.
2. As you fill out the form, real-time validation will display errors below the input fields when invalid data is entered.
3. The form can only be submitted when all fields pass validation.

Technologies Used

- HTML: Structure of the form.
- CSS: Basic styling for form layout and error message presentation.
- JavaScript: Handles real-time validation for the form fields.


This project demonstrates basic client-side form validation techniques that enhance the user experience by providing immediate feedback.
